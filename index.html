                    Romney ― I have a Gucci store that's worth more than Romney. Sorry losers and haters, but my IQ is
                    one of the highest ― and you all know it! Please don't feel so stupid or insecure, it's not your

                  <p><em>1988</em></p>
                  <p>Acquired the Plaza Hotel in Manhattan for $407 million, invested $50 million to restore the
                    building and boosted it from three-star to four-star hotel (I called it "the Mona Lisa" and sold it
                    for a lot of cash in 1995)</p>

                  <p><em>1985</em></p>
                  <p>I bought the Mar-a-Lago estate in Palm Beach and turned it into a private club. You can join if you
                    pay $200K initiation fee (and there is another annual fee for members, it is very expensive to be
                    rich). That year I also opened a casino called Trump Castle. My wife Ivana became a manager, because
                    she is another Trump!</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p><em>1983</em></p>
                  <p>I purchased New Jersey Generals, an American football team. I changed team's play schedule and
                    filed an antitrust lawsuit against United States Football League, so NJG are not doing so good now,
                    but back then they were great!</p>

                    <li>Started developing the Trump Tower skyscraper in Manhattan, I payed a crew of undocumented
                      Polish workers to demolish the historic Bonwit Teller store, including art deco features.</li>
                    <li>All this to make architectural critic Paul Goldberger say in 1983 that the tower's atrium is
                      "the most pleasant interior public space to be completed in New York in some years".</li>
                    <li>At the same time I also started a repair job on the Wollman Rink in Central Park and completed
                      the work in three months for $1.95 million, which was $775,000 less than the initial budget!</li>
